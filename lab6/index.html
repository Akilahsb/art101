  <h2>Challenges</h2>
		<p>For lab 6 we are meant to create a js variables in the console about what we use for trasportation. Then we use that to create a js program and link that to our lab 6 indext.html. A problem that was ran into was me having issues again with linking my js file to my index.html file. Then my partner was able to go over it and help find the issue.</p>

		<p>The results can be seen below with the js output, and this page in general.</p>
