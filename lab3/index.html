	   <h1>Lab 3: File Structures</h1>
		    <p>For this lab I was ment to use the index.html of my art 101 file to create the homepage to all my projects and link them to that said homepage.</p>
		      <h2>Challenges</h2>
				     <p>The challenges that I faced through out lab 3 was on how to properly link all my projects to the homepage. I also struggled a bit with adding the photo as I was writing it incorectly. Then with trying to finish this page I also struggled with figuring out how to get my screenshots to show up. Like before i was writing it wrong, so I managed to figure it out.</p>
